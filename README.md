# ItemShippingCalculator-
This project is an Item shipping calculator. It retrieves input from the user through the console window.
The input is the item name, y or no if the item is fragile, the order total (without shipping), and the destination (USA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, or MARS).
The program calculates the shipping cost through conditionals. The total cost is then found. (shipping total + order total).
The program adds an extra $2.00 if the item is fragile.
The program outputs the item name, the shipping cost, the destination, and the total cost.
The output is written to the console window and to a file named "Order.txt".
